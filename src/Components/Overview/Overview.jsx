                    <p>PFAS, often dubbed "forever chemicals" due to their persistence in the environment and potential health risks,
                         have been a subject of increasing concern in recent years. PFAS are a broad set of chemicals renowned for their unique properties and used in many consumer and industrial applications. PFAS spark global concerns as they can persist and build up in the environment, human bodies and food chains.
                    </p> 
                   <p> PFAS ( per- fluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) are a group of man- made chemicals used globally for many purposes, including water resistance, stain resistance, non- stick coatings in textiles, apparel, and cookware, as well as in semiconductors, circuit boards, and electrical wiring,
                     amongst others. There may be as many as 14000 different PFAS chemicals in existence with often little scientific data on many of them. While some PFAS substances have been the target of regulators over the past decade, the focus on these chemicals generally has recently intensified because of data that indicates that they do not biodegrade in the natural environment.

                   <p>BizStratâ€™s Inaugural PFAS (Forever Chemicals), An African Perspective, Conference 2025, will address the local landscape of proposed Legislation, risk management surrounding PFAS & the Environment, safer alternatives as well as Global perspectives pertaining to FPSA usage in all industry sectors over the 2 days
